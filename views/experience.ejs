            I started my career at a company based in Novosibirsk, Russia, where I worked for four years.
            I've made significant progress in my career here, transitioning from a Junior to a Senior position.
            During my time there, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, from small applications to
            large-scale
            enterprise systems.
            I've gained considerable experience in these projects in both backend and frontend technologies.
